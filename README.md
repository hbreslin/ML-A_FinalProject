- Originally looked atr using ArtGAN dataset. Crashed repeatedly trying to open it! (presumeably bc it was absolutely huge)
- 11/26: decided to change criteria. No longer just whether I like or dislike and image, but rather whether I would hang it in my living space
    - final project: model of my room utilizing all of the images it predicts I would would hang up

- 11/26 Updates
    - 6:00pm start working on a website where i can vote on whether I would hang the image in my room or not.
    - 10:30pm Voting commences!
    - 11:23pm: There's an interesting mix of sketches and completed works for Albrecht DÅ±rer. I find that since a lot of his work is religious, I tend to like the sketches more before the religious aspects are implemented
    - 11:43pm: With ALfred Sisley I liked the sketches less.There are some 'smoother' pieces that I liked more
    - 11:47pm I am not a big fan of Amedeo Modigliani's works
    - 11:58pm looking at some caravaggio pieces. I like his art but I've voted mostly no in terms of putting pieces in my room
    - 12:37 glad i shifted my prompt, there s a ton a pieces I like but would not want to live with. I like Saturn devouring his son, but would NOT want it hanging in my room

    - Considering changing directions due to results when trying to train model. Having a lot of difficulties with data. Potentially intentionally overfit the data and have the model tell me what images i'm supposed to like? reminiscent of the voting in out first reading
